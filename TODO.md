# Grok MCP Development Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

## Phase 1: Core Functionality ‚úÖ (Completed)

- [x] Basic MCP server setup with FastMCP
- [x] Grok API client with retry logic
- [x] Chat completion tool with model selection
- [x] Image understanding capabilities
- [x] Text embeddings support
- [x] List models functionality
- [x] Comprehensive error handling
- [x] Environment-based configuration
- [x] Basic documentation

## Phase 2: Enhanced Features üöß (In Progress)

### Testing & Quality
- [ ] Unit tests for all tools
- [ ] Integration tests with mock API
- [ ] Test coverage > 90%
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks for code quality

### Advanced Tools
- [ ] **Streaming Support**: Real-time response streaming
  ```python
  @mcp.tool
  async def chat_stream(messages, model=None):
      # Stream responses token by token
  ```

- [ ] **Batch Processing**: Process multiple requests efficiently
  ```python
  @mcp.tool
  async def batch_chat(requests: List[Dict]):
      # Handle multiple chat requests in parallel
  ```

- [ ] **Context Management**: Conversation history tracking
  ```python
  @mcp.tool
  async def chat_with_context(message, conversation_id=None):
      # Maintain conversation context
  ```

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Response caching for identical requests
- [ ] Connection pooling for API calls
- [ ] Request deduplication
- [ ] Metrics collection (latency, tokens, costs)

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Interactive CLI for testing tools
- [ ] Request/response logging with rotation
- [ ] Performance profiling tools
- [ ] Debug mode with detailed traces

## Phase 3: Remote Deployment üåê (Planned)

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Docker containerization
  ```dockerfile
  FROM python:3.11-slim
  # Optimized container for MCP server
  ```

- [ ] Kubernetes deployment manifests
- [ ] Helm charts for easy deployment
- [ ] Auto-scaling configuration

### Security & Authentication
- [ ] API key rotation support
- [ ] Request signing/verification
- [ ] Rate limiting per client
- [ ] IP allowlisting
- [ ] Audit logging

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Prometheus metrics export
- [ ] OpenTelemetry integration
- [ ] Health check endpoints
- [ ] Grafana dashboard templates
- [ ] Alert configurations

### Multi-tenancy
- [ ] User/organization isolation
- [ ] Usage tracking per tenant
- [ ] Custom model access controls
- [ ] Billing integration preparation

## Phase 4: Advanced Capabilities üöÄ (Future)

### AI Enhancements
- [ ] **Prompt Optimization**: Automatic prompt enhancement
- [ ] **Response Validation**: Ensure response quality
- [ ] **Multi-modal Pipelines**: Combine text and image analysis
- [ ] **Model Routing**: Smart routing based on request type

### Integration Features
- [ ] **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture
  ```python
  @mcp.plugin
  class CustomProcessor:
      def pre_process(self, request):
          # Custom preprocessing
  ```

- [ ] **Webhook Support**: Event notifications
- [ ] **Database Integration**: Store conversations
- [ ] **Vector Store**: Semantic search capabilities

### Enterprise Features
- [ ] **Compliance Tools**: GDPR, SOC2 support
- [ ] **Data Residency**: Region-specific deployments
- [ ] **Custom Models**: Support for fine-tuned models
- [ ] **SLA Monitoring**: Uptime and performance tracking

### Community & Ecosystem
- [ ] **MCP Hub Integration**: Publish to MCP directory
- [ ] **Example Gallery**: Showcase use cases
- [ ] **Video Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides
- [ ] **Community Plugins**: Third-party extensions
